## Time Series Notebook

*Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?*

Since the p values did not meet the required and quite frankly, they were off by quite a bit, I would stay away from
buying the yen for the moment. A good trading strategy would be to trade on the volatility, as explained next.

*Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?*

Based on the **GARCH** model, the risk is expected to increase

*Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?*

I would, based on the parameters I set on my own personal strategy. I would feel more confortable after studying 
a little more about the models.

## Regression Analysis

*Conclusion*

The rmse for out-of-sample reflects a good analysis as it is under 0.5, while the rmse for the in-sample reflects a poor
analysis.
